# SprintRoute Driver App

## Overview
The **SprintRoute Driver App** is the companion mobile application for drivers on the SprintRoute ride-hailing platform. Inspired by InDrive, this app allows drivers to:

- Accept or decline ride requests
- View trip details and navigate to the pickup location
- Negotiate ride prices within a set standard
- Track completed rides and receive reviews
- Ensure rider safety through in-app features

The app is part of a two-sided system designed to make transportation safer and more flexible for both riders and drivers.

## My Role – DevOps Engineer

As the **DevOps Engineer**, I was responsible for building the CI/CD infrastructure for the Driver App. Although the app was not deployed to a live environment, I developed and tested essential automation pipelines that improved the team's development and testing workflow.

###  Key DevOps Contributions:
- Set up **CI/CD pipelines** using **GitHub** and **Jenkins**
- Configured Jenkins to automatically build the app on every push to the GitHub repository
- Used **Android Studio** and **Expo** to test and simulate builds during development
- Ensured seamless collaboration by managing code integrations and build triggers
- Resolved issues in pipeline execution with the help of AI assistance, improving my understanding of CI/CD as a beginner

## A Note from Me

Despite being new to DevOps at the time, I successfully set up Jenkins to automatically trigger builds based on GitHub activity—a key step in building scalable, production-ready systems. This experience gave me a solid foundation in DevOps practices for mobile app development.
