## My Role – DevOps Engineer

As the DevOps Engineer for this project, I was responsible for setting up and managing the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to streamline development and testing. Although the project was not fully deployed due to academic timelines, I built the foundational infrastructure necessary for automated testing and potential deployment.

### Key Contributions:
- Implemented CI/CD workflows using _GitHub_ and _Jenkins_
- Integrated GitHub with Jenkins to trigger builds automatically when new code was pushed
- Conducted basic testing through **Android Studio** and **Expo**
- Managed project repositories and codebase structure in **Visual Studio Code (VSCode)**
- Troubleshot and resolved CI/CD issues with the help of AI tools, despite being a beginner

#### Tools & Technologies
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins, GitHub Actions
- **Development Environment:** VSCode, Android Studio
- **Testing Tools:** Expo, Android Emulator

##### Project Status
The project was tested locally and within development environments, but it was not deployed to production due to time constraints in the academic calendar. After grading, the team moved on to the next academic year.

###### Lessons & Highlights
Despite limited experience, I successfully configured Jenkins to automate builds on every GitHub commit. This milestone significantly improved the team's development workflow and gave me hands-on experience in DevOps.
